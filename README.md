# RoadMap
- [X] Trigger script execution
- [X] Chat Bot backend (if no command found, Vasilich should reply as a simple chat-bot)
- [X] Extended script execution (interactive mode. Vasilich should notify about script execution process)
- [X] Webhook support
- [ ] Monitoring and Scheduling
- [X] Single Jar packaging. Vasilich should be as simple as possible. (One JAR and one configuration file)
- [ ] IRC connector
- [ ] File sharing. Vasilich should be able to send you logs as a ZIP archive
- [ ] automate deployment to test environment, where everyone can test Vasilich
- [ ] Write WIKI. No one can use this without a simple doc!!!
- [ ] Use programAB instead of ChatterBean
- [X] Create a single command for monitoring instead of multiple commands
