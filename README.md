========

Chat Bot. Can help you with deploy, monitoring and alerting.


# RoadMap
- [X] Trigger script execution
- [ ] Chat Bot backend (if no command found, Vasilich should reply as a simple chat-bot)
- [X] Extended script execution (interactive mode. Vasilich should notify about script execution process)
- [ ] Webhook support
- [ ] Monitoring and Scheduling
- [ ] Single Jar packaging. Vasilich should be as simple as possible. (One JAR and one configuration file)
- [ ] IRC connector
- [ ] File sharing. Vasilich should be able to send you logs as a ZIP archive
- [ ] automate deployment to test environment, where everyone can test Vasilich
